# music-controller

This project is a musiccontroller with spodtify api and is created with react intergrated with django where people can create room and listen to same song
The only drawback of it is that you need premium spotify account to play/pause/skip the song

I have created this project with by learning it from techwithtim django react series
The main motive behind this project was to learn react integrated with django
